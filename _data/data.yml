#         link: "https://github.com/Sazzad-Saju/BSK-Stream-Cipher"
#         tagline: "Bornomala Symmetric Key (BSK) stream cipher is a developed cipher that generated
#         a pair of sub-keys from an input key through a complex key generation technique used in
#         encryption. The slightest change in the input symmetric key produces an entirely different
#         key pair. Hence, different encrypted results exhibit the reliability of the cipher along
#         with modern cryptography. <br> Language: C++ | Development Tools: DevC++ | Time Periods: November, 2020"

#       - title: RSA Algorithm
#         link: "https://github.com/Sazzad-Saju/RSA_Algorithm"
#         tagline: "RSA is a widely used asymmetric cipher that requires two large random prime numbers
#         to generate a public key and a private key to produce ciphertext. This project makes the
#         algorithm workable within any range of prime numbers. So the user of this system can
#         experiment with any inputs. <br> Language: Python | Development Tools: PyCharm | Time Periods: December, 2020 "
